# Humidity Monitoring Sensor

## Overview
This project presents the design and fabrication of a low-cost humidity sensor that converts the chemical moisture absorption of salt into an electrical signal via resistive variation between metal electrodes.

## Principle of Operation
As ambient humidity increases, salt absorbs moisture, changing its electrical resistance. This variation is measured as a change in current, which is calibrated to estimate relative humidity.

## Key Features
- Chemical-to-electrical signal transduction
- No microcontroller required
- Operating range: 20–90% RH
- Simple, low-cost sensor construction

## specifications
- Temperature range is normally 25℃ − 40℃
- Operating Voltage range 3.7 V – 9.0V (DC) 
- Error - ± 7% 

## Experimental Results
The sensor output shows a predictable exponential relationship between humidity and current, validated through repeated measurements and statistical analysis.

## Applications
- Environmental monitoring
- Educational sensor design experiments
- Low-cost instrumentation systems
